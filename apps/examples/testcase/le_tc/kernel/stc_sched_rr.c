/// @brief Scenario test cases for round-robin fairness (family A)
///
/// These assert that round-robin scheduling actually rotates the CPU between
/// equal priority tasks.  The existing API level tests confirm that the
/// configured interval is reported back; a kernel in which round-robin never
/// yields passes it.  The scenarios here fail in that case.
///
/// Each scenario states its oracle as two separate assertions:
///
///   - a hard correctness assertion, which can never be flaky, and
///   - a fairness assertion carrying a tolerance.
///
/// They are kept separate deliberately.  When the suite goes red the failing
/// assertion alone identifies whether behaviour is wrong or merely uneven.

 * With ncpus + 1 workers on ncpus CPUs the ideal share is ncpus/(ncpus + 1)
 * each, so a perfectly fair run gives 100%.  A tight bound would be flaky:
 * over a 3 s window at CONFIG_RR_INTERVAL of 10 ms each worker sees roughly

 * interrupt load both perturb the ratio.  50% sits far below fair and far

 * Name: stc_rr_run_monitored
 *
 * Description:
 *   Applies a workload for a fairness scenario.
 *
 *   The starvation monitor is deliberately NOT started here.
 *
 *   The monitor is a task that wakes every ten milliseconds and blocks
 *   again.  Each time it blocks, sched_removereadytorun() runs on its
 *   CPU, and that function contains the very search of g_readytorun that
 *   round-robin is supposed to perform.  The monitor therefore supplies
 *   rotation on the CPU it is pinned to, at a rate that happens to match
 *   CONFIG_RR_INTERVAL.  Running it alongside a fairness measurement
 *   makes the measurement report the observer rather than the scheduler.
 *
 *   The monitor remains the right instrument for SCN-SMP-01, where it is
 *   the thing being read rather than a bystander.  It has no place in a
 *   scenario whose oracle is a share of CPU time.
 *
 *   Nothing is asserted here, so that teardown always completes before
 *   the caller evaluates anything.
